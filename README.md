# Project Title: Analysis of Customer Satisfaction on Selected Electronic Products

### Abstract
The project explores the impact of recommendation systems on customer satisfaction in the realm of electronic products. It acknowledges technology and the Internet's role in business growth and customer experiences, emphasizing recommendation systems' importance in simplifying product discovery and the need for transparency and effectiveness in these systems.

### Introduction
Various recommendation systems, including hybrid, collaborative, and content-based filtering, are used in electronic product recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction through accuracy, usability, and personalization. Leveraging vast amounts of user data, such as clickstream data and ratings, is crucial for these systems.

### Literature Review
Existing studies and practical applications in recommendation systems are reviewed, focusing on personalized suggestions, filtering personalized information, and different recommender system types and algorithms. The review also discusses the evaluation of recommendation techniques and their potential in educational settings.

### Methodology
The methodology involves using collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering in electronic product recommendations. It discusses factors affecting customer satisfaction, challenges like sparsity and cold start in collaborative filtering, and dominant techniques like SVD, PCA, and clustering.

### Implementation and Analysis
The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate collaborative filtering using RMSE and MAE. Python and various collaborative filtering techniques are used, with visualizations like boxplots and distribution graphs illustrating user ratings and product preferences.

### Results and Discussions
The analysis reveals user ranking patterns, rating distribution, and the absence of missing values in the dataset. Implications for collaborative filtering and recommendation systems are discussed, emphasizing the importance of exploratory data analysis.

### Conclusion
The project highlights recommendation systems' role in predicting customer satisfaction accurately. It mentions the program's ability to make recommendations based on user preferences and the use of libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn in the analysis and coding process.

The project offers a comprehensive analysis of recommendation systems' impact on customer satisfaction, providing insights into the challenges and opportunities in this field.
